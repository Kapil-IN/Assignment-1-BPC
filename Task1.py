#Assignment 1:
## Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#### This Program takes two numbers num1 and num2 as input from the user . It typecast the inputs to int and store in num1 & num2
num1 = int (input('Enter the first number: '))
num2 = int (input('Enter the second number: '))

#### Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers and display the results of each operation on the screen
print('Addition: ', num1+num2)
print('Subtraction: ', num1-num2)
print('Multiplication: ', num1*num2)
print('Division: ', num1/num2)
